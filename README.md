# Instructions
* Cd into the root directory and run 'npm install'
* To run the application, cd into the root directory and enter 'npm start' in your terminal
* To run the test suite, cd into the root directory and enter 'npm run test' in your terminal
* To generate the word count of the text given, enter the text into the text-area element and click the 'Count my words!' button - a table containing the word count will appear below 
* To clear the content of the text-area element, click the 'Clear text' button
* To sort the words by their alphabetical order, click the 'Word' column header and the words will be sorted alphabetically. Click again and they will be sorted in reverse alphabetical order.
* To sort the words by their frequency, click the 'Frequency' column header and the words will be sorted by highest frequency. Click again and they will be sorted in reverse frequency order.

# Assumptions
* Words should not include any punctuation
* Words that contain the same letters, but use different lettercase, are the same word
* An empty string is not a word
* A string containing only punctuation is not a word
* Numbers are not words
* Hyphenated words are made up of multiple words and, as a result, considered different words

I really enjoyed this challenge - happy word counting!
